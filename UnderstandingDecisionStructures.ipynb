    "\n",
    "### Input Validation:\n",
    "- Prompt the user to input their subscription plan. Ensure the input is one of the valid options: \"basic\", \"premium\", or \"platinum\".\n",

    "Calculate the Monthly Fee:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function to check fee is based on the following rules:\n",
    "- If the subscription is basic: If the number of movies watched is greater than 10, the monthly fee is $20.\n",
    "Otherwise, the monthly fee is $10.\n",
    "- If the subscription is premium: If the number of movies watched is greater than 30, the monthly fee is $25.\n",
    "- Otherwise, the monthly fee is $20.\n",
    "- If the subscription is platinum: The monthly fee is always $40.\n",
    "- The function returns the result\n",

    "Output the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Display the subscription plan, the number of movies watched, and the calculated monthly fee.\n",

    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the program to calculate the total yearly fee for the user (12 months based on the same subscription and movie-watching pattern).\n",
    "- Format the fee to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "- Add a feature to suggest upgrading plans based on their movie-watching habits: Example: If a basic user watches more than 30 movies, suggest upgrading to premium.\n",
    "- Create a loop so the program can handle multiple users until the user decides to quit."
